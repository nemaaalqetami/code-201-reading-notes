#### Layout .









we are going to look at how to control where each element sits on a page and how to create attractive



Building Blocks :

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box

Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout,


Containing Elements :

 
 It is common to group a number of elements together inside a `<div>` (or other block-level) element.


Controlling The Position of Element :


CSS has the following `positioning schemes` that allow you to control the layout of a page


Normal Flow 

`Position:static` : In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next
one. 


RElative Positioning 

`position:relative` : Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it
would have been in normal flow



Absolute Positioning 

`position:absolute` :

e position property is given a value of absolute , the box is taken out of normal
flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the pag



Fixed Positioning 


position:fixed

Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.



Foating Elements :

`float`  The float property allows you
to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible



Fixed Width Layouts :


Fixed width layout designs do not
change size as the user increases
or decreases the size of their browser window. 


Liquid Layouts :

Liquid layout designs stretch and contract
as the user increases or decreases the
size of their browser window
