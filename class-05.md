#### Images .












There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.



* f you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses.


Adding Images :

`<img src="your img path" >` we can add more arrributs like width , height

height :This specifies the height of the 
image in pixels.

width :This specifies the width of the 
image in pixels.


* Where an image is placed in the code will affect how it is displayed. 










###  Three Rules for creating Images :








1- Save images in the right format

2- Save images at the right size

3- Use the correct resolution









## Chapter 11 :










#### Color .









###### Color can really bring your pages to life.










Understanding Color :


Every color an a copmuter secrren is reated by mixing ammounts of red ,green , blue you can write your color in three approach

- Name of Color Ex : `<p style="color: red;">`

- Hex codes Ex :` p { color:#FFFFF; }`

- RGB values Ex : `p { rgb(84, 151, 240); }`



color piickers :


This tool makes it easy to create, adjust, and experiment with custom colors for the web.

CSS3: HSL Colors:


CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness values.











## Chapter 12 :











#### Text 










Typeface Terminology :




Serif :Serif fonts have extra details on 
the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are known as serifs.





Sans-Serif :Sans-serif fonts have straight 
ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.




Monospace :Every letter in a monospace (or 
fixed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have different widths.)






Weight : light , Medium ,Bold , Black


Style : Normal , ITalic , Obligque


Stretch : Condensed , Regular,Extended




JPEG vs PNG vs GIF :




Compression :

Compression can be of two types :


 In lossless : compression, it is possible to reconstruct the original image from the compressed image because there is no information loss during compression.



in lossy compression is irreversible. Lossy compression algorithms always have a superior compression ratio (the ratio of size of compressed image to original image)





`JPEG` is a lossy compression specification that takes advantage of human perception.



`PNG` is a lossless image format using DEFLATE compression. No data is lost during compression and no compression artefacts are introduced in the image.


`GIF` is also a lossless image format that uses LZW compression algorithm.
