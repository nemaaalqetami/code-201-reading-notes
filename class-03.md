##  Capter 13 :



Box Dimensions :

By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents,
The most popular ways to specify the size of a box are to use pixels ,When you use percentages,the size of the box is relative to
the size of the browser window


Limiting width :

Some page designs expand and shrink to fit the size of the user's
screen , you can use the max-width property to ensure that lines of text do not appear too wide within a big browser window and you can
use the min-width property to make sure that they do not appear too narrow.


Overflowing content :


The overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content
contained within a box is larger than the box itself


Margin : it's for outside the  porder   .

Padding : it's for inside the porder .

Border : The border separates the edge of one box from another.


Centering content :

we can use `text-align : center ` it well centering the box ot text .


`display : inline -block ` it make the content the horizontal .






Hiding Boxes :it's has to value :

`hidden` & `visible` .


Border images : The border-image property applies an image to the border of any box

This property requires three pieces of information:

1- The URL of the image


2-  Where to slice the image


3-  What to do with the straight edges

##  Chapter 4 :



`if` Statements :
 the if statements evaluates or checks a condition ,if the condition evaluates to `true` any statements in the subsequent code block are executed.

  `if ... else` Statements :
  
  the  if ... else checks a condition. if it resolves to true the first code block is executed,if the condition resolves to false the second code block is run instead.


  `Switch` Statements :
   a switch Statements start with a variable called the switch value ,each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value .



checking Equality :

`==` is used to compare the value of var 


`===` is used to compare the value and datatype of var 




loops :


Loops check a condition ,if it return true . Ex for Loops

FOR it's more common than authors ,if you need to run code a specific number of times . WHILE if you do not know how many times the code should run. DO WHILE is very similar to the while loop.

the for structure for (initial value ;condition; updating statment )
 `{ ` statments

`}`

the while structure while(condition) `{`

statments

`}`
