#### Links .







Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from one web page to another



How we writing Links :

Links are created using the `<a>` element.

`<a herf = "ULR">Your content</a>` thats linked to anther sites . 


How Linking To other pages on The same site :

`<a herf = "name of the html page ">Your content</a>` 


also we can use `Email Linl`
Ex :
`<a herf = "mailo:nemaa@example.com">Email</a>` 

- For opening links in a new window we use 
`target` attribute.

Ex :

`<a herf = "ULR" target= "_blank">Your content</a>` 







##  Chapter 15:








#### Layout .








we are going to look at how to control where each element sits on a page and how to create attractive



Building Blocks :

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box

Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout,


Containing Elements :

 
 It is common to group a number of elements together inside a `<div>` (or other block-level) element.


Controlling The Position of Element :


CSS has the following `positioning schemes` that allow you to control the layout of a page


Normal Flow 

`Position:static` : In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next
one. 


RElative Positioning 

`position:relative` : Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it
would have been in normal flow



Absolute Positioning 

`position:absolute` :

e position property is given a value of absolute , the box is taken out of normal
flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on the pag



Fixed Positioning 


position:fixed

Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed.



Foating Elements :

`float`  The float property allows you
to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible



Fixed Width Layouts :


Fixed width layout designs do not
change size as the user increases
or decreases the size of their browser window. 


Liquid Layouts :

Liquid layout designs stretch and contract
as the user increases or decreases the
size of their browser window

## Chapter 3 :







Fuctions ,Method & object .



Fuctions & Method :


Functions consist of a series of statements 
that have been grouped together because they 
perform a specific task

Object :
 objects are made up of properties and methods


 Declaring a function :

To create a function , you give it a name then write the statments needed to achieve its task inside the curly barces.


Calling a function :



Having declared the function, you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with ust one line of code .



FUNCTION : is very helpfull it's has many benefits

- avoid duplicated


- and it's reusable (created ones and use it many times)

How does pair programming work?


pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. he Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. 



Why pair program?


developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to othersâ€™ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.

1- Greater efficiency


 When coming up with ideas and discussing solutions out loud, two programmers may come to a solution faster than one programmer on their own.


2- Engaged collaboration



When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone




3- Learning from fellow students :


 If one developer has a unique approach to a specific problem, pair programming exposes the other developer to a new solution.


 4- Social skills :


 When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key. Pair programming not only improves programming skills, but can also help programmers develop their interpersonal skills.



5- Job interview readiness:

A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant, either in person or through a shared screen. They will carry out exercises together,


 6- Work environment readiness :
