#### Images :








Controlling the size and alignment of 
your images using CSS keeps rules that 
affect the presentation of your page in 
the CSS and out of the HTML markup.




Controlling Sizes OF Images In CSS :



You can control the size of an 
image using the width and 
height properties in CSS, just 
like you can for any other box. 


Alignig Images Using CSS :


you saw how the float property can be used 
to move an element to the left or 
the right of its containing block, 
allowing text to flow around it.



Centering Images Using CSS :


By default, images are inline 
elements. This means that they 
flow within the surrounding text. 
In order to center an image, it 
should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display
property with a value of block. 



Background Images :


The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML 
element. This could be the entire 
page or just part of the page. By 
default, a background image will 
repeat to fill the entire box.

#### Practical Information : 








we are going to learn at some practical information that will 
help you launch a successful site.




Search Engine Optimization (SEO):



The Basics :

Search engine optimization (or 
SEO) is the practice of trying 
to help your site appear nearer 
the top of search engine results 
when people look for the topics 
that your website covers.



On-Page Techniques: 

On-page techniques are the 
methods you can use on your 
web pages to improve their 
rating in search engines.


Off-Page Techniques :

Getting other sites to link to you 
is just as important as on-page 
techniques. Search engines help 
determine how to rank your 
site by looking at the number of 
other sites that link to yours.



Hoe To Identify KeyWords And Pharses:


Determining which keywords to use on your site can be one of the 
hardest tasks when you start to think about SEO. Here are six steps that 
will help you identify the right keywords and phrases for your site.


1- Brainstorm

List down the words that 
someone might type into 
Google to find your site. Be sure 
to include the various topics, 
products or services your site is 
about.


2- Organize

Group the keywords into 
separate lists for the different 
sections or categories of your 
website.

3- Research

There are several tools that let 
you enter your keywords and 
then they will suggest additional 
keywords


4- Compare

It is very unlikely that your 
site will appear at the top of 
the search results for every 
keyword. This is especially true 
for topics where there is a lot 
of competition.


5- Refine

Now you need to pick which 
keywords you will focus on. 
These should always be the ones 
that are most relevant to each 
section of your site.

6- Map

Now that you have a refined list 
of keywords, you know which 
have the most competition, and 
which ones are most relevant, 
it is time to start picking which 
keywords you will use for each 
page






## Chapter 9 :






* Selecting Elements By Tag Name :



`The get El ementsByTagName ()` method allows you to select elements using their tag name. 


The element name is specified 
as a parameter, so it is placed 
inside the parentheses and is 
contained by quote marks. 




* Selecting Elements Using CSS Selectors :

`querySe 1 ector()` returns 
the first element node that 
matches the CSS-style selector. 
`querySe 1ectorA11 ()` returns a 
Nodelist of all of the matches. 

Both methods take a CSS 
selector as their only parameter. 


* Repeating Actions For An Enter NodeList :

When youmhave a nodeList , you can loop through each node in the collection and apply the same statements to each.



* Looping Through a NodeList :

If you want to apply the same 
code to numerous elements, 
looping through a Nodelist is a 
powerful technique. 

It involves finding out how many 
items are in the Nodelist, and 
then setting a counter to loop 
through them, one-by-one. 

Each time the loop runs, the 
script checks that the counter 
is less than the total number of 
items in the Nodelist.
