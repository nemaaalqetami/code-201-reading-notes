IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES 

IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS

### Chapter 5: “Document Object Model” :










The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies 
how browsers should create a model of an HTML 
page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 


The DOM Tree is a Model Of a Web Page :

As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page. The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory. 


Working with the DOM Tree .

Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps: 

1- Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with. 


2- Use its text content, child elements, and attributes. 


Caching DOM Queries :


Method that find elements in the DOM tree called DOM queries.


Nodelists: DOM Queries That Return more Than 
One Element :

When a DOM method can return more than one element, it returns a Nodelist (even if it only finds one matching element). 

Accessing Elements :

DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist, which is a collection of nodes.
