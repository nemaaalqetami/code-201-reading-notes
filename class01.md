## Html
##### Introduction
###### How Websites Are Created :
Small websites are often written just using HTML and CSS.Larger websites those that are updated regularly and use a content management system (CMS), blogging tools, or
e-commerce software â€” often make use of more complex technologies on the web server,but these technologies are actually used to produce HTML and CSS that is then sent to the browse


How the Web Works ?

When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

Structure:
HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages ,There are several different elements. Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag.Tags act like containers. They tell you about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.
Ex : 

`<p> this is opening tag`
`</p> this is closing tag`
`<img/> this is called it self closing tag`
Attributes : is tell us more about elements, attibutes provide information about the content of an element ,they appear on the opening tag ,and are made up of two parts 
name and value  separated by an equals sign.


Ex:

`<a src="">your content </a> attributes `src` ,here we can  provide the url about the link,
let me show you the html structure
firt we should begin 
<!DOCTYPE html > that tag tell the browser what version of html we use it 
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
insid head tag we can write the name of our website using tittle tag
insid body tag we write all elements of html.`


Extra Markup :

 ### DOCTYPE 
`stands for Document Type Declaration`
Tell the browser what version of html we use , and must be begin with it
for html5 ,we use it `!DOCTYPE html` but it's not considered an element or html tag and every version of html has own DOCTYPE



### Comments in HTML : 
 developers use comment to leave notes to understand each other
 also, the developer comment the element of html because doesn't need it  but can use it again any time

`<!-- comments parts  -->`

### ID Attribute :

id attribute must Unique for styling just `one element in html` and should be starting `# ` sign and the name of id then call it in youe element ` <p id="the name of class">` like that .
 

 ### CLASS Attribute :
 class attribute it used for styling multiple elements  and should be starting `. ` sign and the name of class ,then call it in youe element ` <p class ="the name of class">`


  `<div>` tag is used for defining a section of your page and can   
       contain another div inside it

  `<span>` tag is used for to styling or organizing a part of content 

  `<iframes>` tag is organizing your content to look like box and
       you can scrolling it
    `<meta>` tag is not displayed to website visitor but is provided for 
    use by browsers and web , also is used to `add machine-readable information to an HTML pages`
      
      
`<character escape>` is a way pf representing a character using only   

 ASCII characters
